# GRASS: General Random Alphabetical Single-Character Substituitions :star:

The project is inspired by the pseudo localization demo from [suntrise/pseudo](https://github.com/suntrise/pseudo/).

But I made it a bit more versatile... Enabling to:

- read custom JSON / default JSON config file to substitute more freely, not only the alphas, but also custom characters- whatever you want , just type it in JSON file;
- faster substitution using C# which will be useful to process a big file;
- Reconstructed codes, extended maintainbility, more UTs covered.

Building and testing processes used GitHub Actions and PowerShell scripts (I :heart: PowerShell), and all codes released under MIT License.
